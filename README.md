# spring-boot-jzos-sample

The intent of this sample is primarily to be a test application that can demonstrate onboarding to Zowe. By creating a Spring Boot App we can quickly demonstrate a z based Rest API application 

It is also a good sample for anyone wishing to create a Rest API Spring Boot application that creates swagger2.

This sample uses JZOS to provision a Rest API for accessing Java environmental variables.

## Prerequisites 

* Build requires Maven installed on local machine

### Keystore
As this sample runs using HTTPS you need to reference a key store or create your own. Although creating your own is relatively straight forward I have reused the one used by the API mediation layer. It's worth noting that at the time of writing this Readme I have used a relative reference to the keystore and you should update based upon the location of the Zowe keystore used. 
  
  
### IBMJZOS.jar
The app has a dependency on IBMJZOS so for compiling you need to download from your z/OS installation. Simply download the file from your Java installation on the z/OS server. $JAVA_HOME/lib/ext/ibmjzos.jar call it ibmjzos-1.0.jar and save in the /libs folder of this project.  

## Procedure

* Download this sample to your local machine. 
* Download IBMJZOS from the host machine running Zowe. Create a lib folder off the project root and create the ibmjzos-1.0.jar file for compilation purposes
* Build the sample and transfer the file /jzos/target/jzos-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar to a USS folder on the Zowe server. (mvn clean verify)
* Transfer the jzos.sh file from the project root folder to the same USS folder on the Zowe server.
* Modify the shell script as necessary for the environment

### Shell Script

The shell script builds the required command to specify the classpath and set environmental properties. Please check the valiidity on your system of:
* Location of JAVA_HOME
* Your installation location
* An available port number

It is envisaged that you will eventually set this to run as a service but will suffice for a sample. 
 
### Access swagger

Use the address https://{zowe installation host}:{your defined port}/api/v1/swagger-ui.html to access the swagger page. Scroll down to click on JzOS Variables controller then choose "Try it out" and then "Execute" to make sure the API works.

###Â Introduce your application to the Gateway. 

To allow your application to be accessible through the API Gateway you need to add a yaml file to the API-definitions folder. Use the zowe-api-jzos-mediation-configure.sh script to achieve this. You will need to add the following values into the script.

```
# Fill in the following variables
ZOWE_ROOT_DIR=    # The root directory of the Zowe installation
ZOWE_EXPLORER_HOST=   # Host name of the Zowe installation
JZOS_PORT=57949       # The address where your application is running 
```

Run this script and the yaml file will be created with the appropriate configuration. Restart Zowe to pick up the definition
